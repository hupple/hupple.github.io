Burr and Rosta, extending a famous conjecture by Erdős, conjectured that every graph is common, which was disproved by Thomason and by Sidorenko in late 1980s. Collecting new examples for common graphs had not seen much progress since then, although very recently, a few more graphs are verified to be common by the flag algebra method or the recent progress on Sidorenko's conjecture.\nOur contribution here is to give a new class of tripartite common graphs. The first example class is so-called triangle trees, which generalises two theorems by Sidorenko and hence answers a question by Jagger,  Šťovíček, and Thomason from 1996. We also prove that, somewhat surprisingly, given any tree T, there exists a triangle tree such that the graph obtained by adding T as a pendant tree is still common. Furthermore, we show that some complete tripartite graphs, e.g., the octahedron graph K_2,2,2, are common and conjecture that every complete tripartite graph is common.\nJoint work with Andrzej Grzesik, Bernard Lidický, and Jan Volec.

DESCRIPTION:Abstract: We say that a graph G is H-free if G does not contain H as a (not necessarily induced) subgraph. For a positive integer n, denote by ex(n,H) the largest number of edges in an H-free graph with n vertices (the Turán number of H). The classical theorem of Erdős, Kleitman, and Rothschild states that, for every r≥3, there are 2ex(n,H)+o(n2) many Kr-free graphs with vertex set {1,…, n}. There exist (at least) three different derivations of this estimate in the literature: an inductive argument based on the Kővári-Sós-Turán theorem (and its generalisation to hypergraphs due to Erdős), a proof based on Szemerédi's regularity lemma, and an argument based on the hypergraph container theorems. In this talk, we present yet another proof of this bound that exploits connections between entropy and independence. This argument is an adaptation of a method developed in a joint work with Gady Kozma, Tom Meyerovitch, and Ron Peled that studied random metric spaces.

DESCRIPTION:Abstract: Let X1, … be i.i.d. copies of some real random variable X. For any ε2, ε3, … in {0,1}, a basic algorithm introduced by H.A. Simon yields a reinforced sequence X̂1, X̂2, … as follows. If εn=0, then X̂n is a uniform random sample from X̂1, …, X̂n-1; otherwise X̂n is a new independent copy of X. The purpose of this talk is to compare the scaling exponent of the usual random walk S(n)=X1 +… + Xn with that of its step reinforced version Ŝ(n)=X̂1+… + X̂n. Depending on the tail of X and on asymptotic behavior of the sequence εj, we show that step reinforcement may speed up the walk, or at the contrary slow it down, or also does not affect the scaling exponent at all. Our motivation partly stems from the study of random walks with memory, notably the so-called elephant random walk and its variations.

DESCRIPTION:Zoom Meeting ID: 830 9689 8964\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/83096898964\nPassword: WC2020\nLet G be a connected unimodular group and let μG be a Haar measure on G. Kemperman showed that for compact A and B in G, μG(AB)≥min(μG(A)+μG(B),μG(G)). This implies that the n-fold product An of A has μG(An)≥min(nμG(A),μG(G)) and when G is not compact, limn→∞μG(An)/(nμG(A))≥1. We obtain simple classifications of G, A, and B such that the equalities hold, answering a question asked by Kemperman in 1964. We also get near equality versions of the above results with explicit bound for compact G, confirming conjectures made by Griesmer and by Tao. Our strategy of proof involves reducing the problem to Lie groups through the use of an argument inspired by Breuillard--Green--Tao's classification of approximate groups via Hrushovski's Lie model theorem, and then developing new techniques to reduce the Lie group problem to the case of tori. This is joint work with Minh Tran.

DESCRIPTION:https://webconf.u-bordeaux.fr/b/mar-ef4-zed\nA ``pure pair'' in a graph G is a pair (X,Y) of disjoint subsets of V(G) such that either every vertex in X is adjacent to every vertex in Y, or there are no edges from X to Y. Let f(G) be the biggest k such that G has a pure pair (X,Y) with |X|,|Y| at least k. In general, f(G) is logarithmic in |G|, and for any fixed graph H, if G does not contain H as an induced subgraph then f(G) is polynomial in |G|. (This is a result of Erdos, Hajnal and Pach.) But when is f(G) linear in |G|? This is connected with the Erdos-Hajnal conjecture and the Gyarfas-Sumner conjecture.\nA couple of years ago, we proved a nice thing, a conjecture of Liebenau and Pilipczuk: for any finite set C of graphs, f(G) is linear in |G| for all graphs with no induced subgraph in C, if and only if C contains a forest and the complement of a forest. This result has since grown a number of extensions and variations. (What about bipartite graphs? What about ordered graphs? What about nearly-linear? What if the two sets have different sizes?). We give a tour.\nJoint work with Maria Chudnovsky, Jacob Fox, Alex Scott and Sophie Spirkl.
