DESCRIPTION:https://zoom.com.cn/j/92368341744\nPassword: 061801\nAbstract: Suppose that Y_1, …, Y_N are i.i.d. (independent identically distributed) random variables and let X = Y_1 + … + Y_N. The classical theory of large deviations allows one to accurately estimate the probability of the tail events X < (1-c)E[X] and X > (1+c)E[X] for any positive c. However, the methods involved strongly rely on the fact that X is a linear function of the independent variables Y_1, …, Y_N. There has been considerable interest—both theoretical and practical—in developing tools for estimating such tail probabilities also when X is a nonlinear function of the Y_i. One archetypal example studied by both the combinatorics and the probability communities is when X is the number of triangles in the binomial random graph G(n,p).\nTalk I: We will give a very gentle introduction to the theory of large deviations and discuss the history of the large deviation problem for triangle counts.

DESCRIPTION:https://cesnet.zoom.us/j/96398784345\nPassword: 23571113\nAbstract: We show that the `Upper Matching Conjecture' of Friedland, Krop, and Markström and the analogous conjecture of Kahn for independent sets in regular graphs hold for all large enough graphs as a function of the degree. That is, for every d and every large enough n divisible by 2d, a union of n/(2d) copies of the complete d-regular bipartite graph maximises the number of independent sets and matchings of any given size over all d-regular graphs on n vertices. For the proof, we'll discuss two different approaches to these problems, both inspired by statistical physics. This is joint work with Ewan Davies and Will Perkins.

DESCRIPTION:Zoom Meeting ID: 830 9689 8964\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/83096898964\nPassword: WC2020\nConsider a random graph process, in which edges are added to an empty graph consecutively in a uniformly chosen random order. A classical result by Bollobás and Frieze state that at the first moment the graph no longer contains vertices of degree less than 2k, it also typically contains k edge disjoint Hamilton cycles.\nWe extend this result to random subgraph processes, in which only edges of a given base graph are added, for certain families of dense base graphs.\nBased on a joint work with Michael Krivelevich.
