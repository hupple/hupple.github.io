DESCRIPTION:https://zoom.com.cn/j/92368341744\nPassword: 061801\nAbstract: Suppose that Y_1, …, Y_N are i.i.d. (independent identically distributed) random variables and let X = Y_1 + … + Y_N. The classical theory of large deviations allows one to accurately estimate the probability of the tail events X < (1-c)E[X] and X > (1+c)E[X] for any positive c. However, the methods involved strongly rely on the fact that X is a linear function of the independent variables Y_1, …, Y_N. There has been considerable interest—both theoretical and practical—in developing tools for estimating such tail probabilities also when X is a nonlinear function of the Y_i. One archetypal example studied by both the combinatorics and the probability communities is when X is the number of triangles in the binomial random graph G(n,p).\nTalk II: We will present a complete solution to the upper tail problem for triangle counts in G(n,p) that was obtained recently in a joint work with Matan Harel and Frank Mousset.

DESCRIPTION:https://cesnet.zoom.us/j/98822033687\nPassword: 23571113\nAbstract: A classical result of Galai asserts that the vertex-set of every graph can be partitioned into two sets such that each induces a graph with all degrees even. Scott studied the (harder) problem of determining for which graphs can we find a partition into arbitrary many parts, each of which induces a graph with all odd degrees.\nIn this talk we discuss various extensions of this problem to arbitrary residues mod q>2. Among other results, we show that for every q, a typical graph G(n,1/2) can be equipartitioned (up to divisibility conditions) into q+1 sets, each of which spans a graph with a prescribed degree sequence.\nSwitching to a completely unrelated problem: based on idea of the main key lemma of the above results, we give non-trivial bound (but weaker than known results) on the singularity probabbility of a random symmetric Bernoulli matrix. The new argument avoids both decoupling and distance from random hyperplanes and it turns this problem into a simple and elegant exercise.\nThe first part of the talk is based on a joint work with Liam Hardiman (UCI) and Michael Krivelevich (Tel Aviv University).

DESCRIPTION:Zoom Meeting ID: 830 9689 8964\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/83096898964\nPassword: WC2020\nA conjecture of Erdős from 1967 asserts that any graph on $n$ vertices which does not contain a fixed $r$-degenerate bipartite graph $F$ has at most $Cn^{2−1/r}$ edges, where $C$ is a constant depending only on $F$. We show that this bound holds for a large family of $r$-degenerate bipartite graphs, including all $r$-degenerate blow-ups of trees. Our results generalize many previously proven cases of the Erdős conjecture, including the related results of Furedi and Alon, Krivelevich and Sudakov. Joint work with Oliver Janzer and Zoltán Lóránt Nagy.

DESCRIPTION:https://canterbury.zoom.us/j/92511352067\nAbstract: We define a branching process to understand the locality or otherwise of the critical percolation in the hypercube; that is, whether the local structure of the hypercube can explain the critical percolation as a function of the dimension of the hypercube.\nThe branching process mimics the local behaviour of an exploration of a percolated hypercube; it is defined recursively as follows. Start with a single individual in generation 0. On an first stage, each individual has independent Poisson offspring with mean (1+p)(1-q)k where k depends on the ancestry of the individual; on the merger stage, each pair of cousins merges with probability q.\nWe exhibit evidence of a critical merger probability qc=qc(p) for extinction of the branching process. When p is sufficiently small, the first order terms of qc coincide with those of the critical percolation for the hypercube, suggesting that percolation in the hypercube is dictated by its local structure. This is work in progress with Laura Eslava and Sarah Penington.

DESCRIPTION:https://us02web.zoom.us/j/279059822\nPassword 141592\nAbstract: We develop novel techniques which allow us to prove a diverse range of results relating to subset sums and complete sequences of positive integers, including solutions to several long standing open problems. These include: solutions to the three problems of Burr and Erdös on Ramsey complete sequences, for which Erdös later offered a combined total of 350 analogous results for the new notion of density complete sequences; the answer to a question of Alon and Erdös on the minimum number of colors needed to color the positive integers less than  so that  cannot be written as a monochromatic sum; the exact determination of an extremal function introduced by Erdös and Graham and first studied by Alon on sets of integers avoiding a given subset sum; and, answering a question of Tran, Vu and Wood, a common strengthening of seminal results of Szemerédi-Vu and Sárközy on long arithmetic progressions in subset sums.\nBased on joint work with David Conlon and Huy Tuan Pham.
