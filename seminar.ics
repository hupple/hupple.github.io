DESCRIPTION:https://zoom.com.cn/j/96786380622\nPassword: 016801\nAbstract: In recent decades, independent sets in the discrete hypercube has received a lot of attention from many notable researchers.The classical result of Korshunov and Sapozhenko in 1983 counts the number of independent sets in the hypercube, and then shows that typical independent sets are not far from the trivial construction.For an odd integer n=2d-1, let \mathcal{B}(n, d) be the subgraph of the hypercube induced by the two largest layers. Our new results describe the typical structure of independent sets in \mathcal{B}(n, d) and also give precise asymptotics on the number of them. The proofs use Sapozhenko's graph container lemma, and a recently developed method of Jenssen and Perkins, which combines Sapozhenko's graph container lemma with a classcal tool from statistical physics, the cluster expansion for polymer models.\nThis is a joint work with Jozsef Balogh and Ramon I. Garcia.

DESCRIPTION:https://cesnet.zoom.us/j/97492220523\nPassword: 23571113\nAbstract: There are many impressive results asserting that the chromatic number of a random graph is sharply concentrated. In 1987, Shamir and Spencer showed that for any function p=p(n), the chromatic number of G(n,p) takes one of at most about n^(1/2) consecutive values whp. For sparse random graphs, much sharper concentration is known to hold: Alon and Krivelevich proved two point concentration whenever p < n^(-1/2-epsilon).\nHowever, until recently no non-trivial lower bounds for the concentration were known for any p, even though the question was raised prominently by Erdős in 1992 and Bollobás in 2004.\nIn this talk, we show that the chromatic number of G(n, 1/2) is not whp contained in any sequence of intervals of length n^(1/2-o(1)), almost matching Shamir and Spencer's upper bound.\nJoint work with Oliver Riordan.

DESCRIPTION:Zoom Meeting ID: 830 9689 8964\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/83096898964\nPassword: WC2020\nGiven two non-negative integers n and s, define m(n,s) to be the maximal number such that in every hypergraph H on n vertices and with at most m(n,s) edges there is a vertex x such that |Hx|≥|E(H)|−s, where Hx={H∖{x}:H∈E(H)}.\nThis problem has been posed by Füredi and Pach and by Frankl and Tokushige. While the first results were only for specific small values of s, Frankl determined m(n,2d−1−1) for all d with d∣n. Subsequently, the goal became to determine m(n,2d−1−c) for larger c. Frankl and Watanabe determined m(n,2d−1−c) for c∈{0,2} and d∣n. Other general results are not known so far.\nOur main result sheds light on what happens further away from powers of two: We prove that m(n,2d−1−c)=nd(2d−c) for d≥4c and d∣n and give an example showing that this formula does not hold for c=d+1. The other line of research on this problem is to determine m(n,s) for small values of s. Our second result determines m(n,2d−1−c) for c∈{3,4} for all d with d∣n. This solves more instances of the problem for small s and in particular solves a conjecture by Frankl and Watanabe.\nThis is joint work with Simón Piga.
