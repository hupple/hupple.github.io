DESCRIPTION:Zoom ID: 94939388793\nhttps://cesnet.zoom.us/j/94939388793\nPassword: 23571113\nAbstract: We consider rooted subgraphs in random graphs, i.e., extension counts such as (a) the number of triangles containing a given `root' vertex, or (b) the number of paths of length three connecting two given `root' vertices.\nIn 1989 Spencer gave sufficient conditions for the event that, whip, all roots of the binomial random graph G(n,p) have the same asymptotic number of extensions, i.e., (1 \pm \epsilon) times their expected number.\nFor the important strictly balanced case, Spencer also raised the fundamental question whether these conditions are necessary.\nWe answer this question by a careful second moment argument, and discuss some intriguing problems that remain open.\nJoint work with Matas Sileikis, see arXiv:1911.03012

DESCRIPTION:Zoom ID: TBD\nAbstract: How long does it take for a pandemic to stop spreading? When modelling an infection process, especially these days, this is one of the main questions that comes to mind. In this talk, we consider this question in the bootstrap percolation setting.\nGraph-bootstrap percolation, also known as weak saturation, was introduced by Bollobás in 1968. In this process, we start with initial "infected" set of edges E0, and we infect new edges according to a predetermined rule. Given a graph H and a set of previously infected edges E_t ⊆ E(Kn), we infect a non-infected edge e if it completes a new copy of H in G=([n] , Et ∪ {e}). A question raised by Bollobás asks for the maximum time the process can run before it stabilizes. Bollobás, Przykucki, Riordan, and Sahasrabudhe considered this problem for the most natural case where H=Kr. They answered the question for r ≤ 4 and gave a non-trivial lower bound for every r ≥ 5. They also conjectured that the maximal running time is o(n2) for every integer r. We disprove their conjecture for every r ≥ 6 and we give a better lower bound for the case r=5; in the proof we use the Behrend construction. This is a joint work with József Balogh, Alexey Pokrovskiy, and Tibor Szabó.
