DESCRIPTION:Zoom ID: 94060901954\nhttps://cesnet.zoom.us/j/94060901954\nPassword: 23571113\nAbstract: What is the largest number f(n) such that n points in the plane (no three on a line) always determine f(n) pairwise crossing segments. This natural question was asked by Aronov, Erdős, Goddard, Kleitman, Klugerman, Pach, and Schulman in 1991 and they proved f(n)=Omega(sqrt(n)). The prevailing conjecture was that this bound is far from optimal and f(n) is probably linear in n. Nevertheless, this lower bound was not improved till last year, when  we proved with János Pach and Natan Rubin an almost (but not quite) linear lower bound. Our result gives f(n)>n/exp(O(sqrt(log n))). Determining whether f(n) is truly linear is an intriguing open problem.

DESCRIPTION:Abstract: The small subgraph conditioning method is an analysis of variance technique which was introduced by Robinson and Wormald in 1992, in their proof that almost all cubic graphs are Hamiltonian. The method has been used to prove many structural results about random regular graphs, mostly to show that a certain substructure is present with high probability. I will discuss some applications of the small subgraph conditioning method to hypergraphs, and describe a subtle issue which is absent in the graph setting.

DESCRIPTION:Abstract: We study the following question at the intersection of extremal and structural graph theory. Given a fixed graph H that embeds in a fixed surface Σ, what is the maximum number of copies of H in an n-vertex graph that embeds in Σ? Exact answers to this question are known for specific graphs H when Σ is the sphere. We aim for more general, albeit less precise, results. We show that the answer to the above question is Θ(nf(H)), where f(H) is a graph invariant called the `flap-number' of H, which is independent of Σ. This simultaneously answers two open problems posed by Eppstein (1993). When H is a complete graph we give more precise answers. This is joint work with Tony Huynh and Gwenaël Joret [https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13777].
